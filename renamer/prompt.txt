Analyze this image and generate an appropriate filename following these strict rules:

1. **Structure**: [type]-[descriptive-words].[extension]
   - Start with the image type (photo, icon, logo, illustration, screenshot, diagram, etc.)
   - Follow with 2-4 descriptive words that clearly identify the content

2. **Character Rules**:
   - Use only lowercase letters (a-z)
   - No uppercase letters allowed
   - No numbers (0-9) allowed
   - No special characters except hyphens (-)
   - Use hyphens (-) to separate all words
   - No spaces, underscores, or other separators

3. **Content Guidelines**:
   - Be explicit and descriptive about what's in the image
   - Keep it concise (total filename under 40 characters before extension)
   - Focus on the main subject/purpose of the image
   - Include relevant context (location, time of day, action, etc.) if important

4. **Output Format**:
   - Return ONLY the filename without the file extension
   - Do not include explanations, just the filename
   - Do not use quotes or any formatting around the filename

Examples of good filenames:
- photo-sunset-beach-silhouette
- icon-user-profile-circle
- logo-company-brand-horizontal
- screenshot-dashboard-analytics
- illustration-cat-sleeping-cartoon

Now analyze the image and generate the filename.
