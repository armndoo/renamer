# Renamer


## WIP
Simple python program that  renames the last image downloaded in the Downloads folder.

I hated how people online called images. Like you could see "ada8d848124.jpg" and then its a tree. Just name it "tree.jpg" no.

Just kidding I know why they do this. But I only made this for fun and personal use so..
