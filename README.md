# renamer.py
Simple Python script that takes the last image in the Downloads folder of a specified user and renames it using an AI model to a more readable and appropriate name.

## Why I made this
One day I saw that an image I downloaded from the internet had a completely off-topic name for the image itself. So I thought: "Why does it have to be this way?".
And I made this. It was fun. Also my first time using an AI Model API.
Maybe in future I'll do something more complicated with this. Idk... we'll see.
